##### How is our product different?
We differentiate our product from the products provided by the above companies as follows. The above companies provide supply chain managment software that provide analytics about their clients supply chain. On the contrary the product we are creating is primarly a web based eCommerce platform where small to medium sized businesses get to find and initiate business relations with producers that meet their  requirements.

##### If our product is better for specific users and/or specific scenarios
Our product is geared towards small/medium sized businesses such as botique restaurants and retail stores that are looking for producers who can meet their weekly supply demands. Some sample scenarios where our product is better as follows.
1. When a small business owner is starting up his/her new restaurant and his looking for suppliers who can deliver supplies such as napkins, plastic untensils. He/She can can use our product to find producers of such material that appeals to them and place orders from that producer. This is benificial to the small business owner as he has a greater variety of suppliers to choose from compared to the traditional supply chain managment system.
2. Suppose a business owner is dissatisfied with their current supplier, the traditional supply chain system causes them to spend considerable amount of time to find a new supplier that they like. With our product this is made easy as the business owner can choose from on of the other producer listed on our platform and switch easily.
