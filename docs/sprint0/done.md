## What does *done* mean to our team?

* **Done** means that features developed within a sprint is 100% complete by the end of the sprint.

* Our team ensures that each feature is fully developed, test, styled and accepted by all team members before calling it **done**.

* Some features may have to rely on others, but on its own, a feature must be **shippable**.

* For a feature to be **shippable**, it means that it can be accepted by other dependent features that it relies on. 

* Thus, our team had decided that if we are ever unsure whether a feature is **done enough**, we ask one simple question, **Is this feature shippable?**

* There will be situations where features must be completed in parallel, so to manage this, within the work of each of our developer, they will not move on to a new feature until the last one is **shippable**.

* By ensuring that the overall product is in a **done** state at the end of a sprint, it will not raise cases where some features are 80% completed or untested.
