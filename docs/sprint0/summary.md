# **Summary**

#### *Description of the Project*
This application will provide a platform to help businesses establish connections with manufacturer for operational supplies.
Users can choose to advertise their own business or look for suppliers to establish supply chain connections. This application will make it easy and efficient for consumers and manufacturer to buy and sell products. Operation will be done through the website, where manufacturers will submit product details to the website and price, then consumers will purchase directly on the website. Products will be certified/verified by the website. Manufacturer will have the ability to pay a premium fee, to have their listings "bumped" to the the top of the product listings, or featured on more prominent section of the website. This website will provide a convenient way for medium-sized businesses to purchase recurring products.

* **Scenarios**
    * Scenario 1:

        Jennifer's suppliers called in and said that her the supplies she ordered weren't going to come in for another 2 weeks. She needed to order a bundle of forks and spoons for her restaurant. This user needs a platform to quickly and easily order products.

    * Scenario 2:

        Mrs.Margaretovich needs to order 300 foldable boxes for her flower business. She does not have time to talk with a supplier, as her hands are full with dealing with her kids. This user needs an app/website where she can register and order products without directly speaking to a supplier.

    * Scenario 3

        John's current platform isn't meeting corporate goals of expanding to smaller business customers. His current platform does not provide him enough for all his business customers to fully make use of it. So, John looks into a new platform that provides the expansion between consumer and producer.

* **Principles**:
    * User friendly, intuitive experience over System Efficiency
        The design should provide a great user experience even if it incurs an inefficiency in the system.
    * Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
        The software should a functional piece of work rather than having overcomplicated documentation for users.
    * Aesthetic Integrity
        The design should be clean and visually appealing to the users.
    * Consistency
        The application must be consistent throughout the entire process.
    * Simplicity over Complexity
        The application must remain simple as users will not continue with the application if it is complicated.
