## Process

The team was initially organized using the Facebook Messenger group chat as our tool, using it to get everyone acquainted and for our very early administration tasks. Once the group was properly established we made a transition to Slack, using it as a tool to maintain focused conversations and a work distribution tool. Slack enables us to clearly see who has been designated what task and alerts everyone when a team member declares that they are finished, allowing us to know what work is left without much effort.

<br/>

The major group decision-making was made by consensus during in-person meetings. Each group member was open to the ideas of the others and we would generally go through a revision of an idea two or three times until each group member was satisfied. Since the majority of the group goes to the same tutorial we began our in-person discussions very early to come to our general idea. Minor group decisions, such as work distribution, were often lead by one individual with volunteers when applicable. Those decisions were flexible and were modified as the group discussed them when needed, always decided in person.

<br/>

During our first official meeting we split up the work required for Sprint 0 as evenly as we could. Each individual of the group was responsible for a write-up of one of the files or personas, marked accordingly on Slack, which had been agreed upon. The summary and other important documents for our project were first outlined in this meeting as well through a group discussion. Though each task was given to one individual, each task was also given a revisor who would give the document a second pass or revision. This was done mostly to guarantee that our documentation had the full story and that nothing was left out or incorrect. Upon task completion we would mark the work as done in Slack, alerting the entire group of its completion.

<br/>

We chose to use the Fibonacci sequence for the size estimates since it grows exponentially so the gaps between larger numbers is greater. This makes it easier to estimate the larger stories without wasting time debating the size difference.
Also if we decide that a user story should be broken up into smaller components, it is easy to give sizes since we can make them the 2 previous Fibonacci numbers.

<br/>

For the priority we used 2 scales from 1 to 5 for urgency and value it adds to the product so the max priority is 25.
We did this since it is easier to break up the priority into smaller scales instead of trying to balance different factors in 1 scale.
This gives us a more accurate priority since it needs to add enough value to the product as well as being something that should be added relatively quickly.
We then multiply the priority of the 2 scales to get our overall priority.

<br/>

The team met twice in person for Sprint 0 and once before any sprint was approaching in order to formulate our idea. In the first meeting we did our initial work distribution and agreed upon a weekly meeting time that will recur each week throughout the semester. If need be we have another day that we have seen can work for meetings, though that would only be scheduled if our weekly meeting was insufficient. We agreed that most of our meetings should happen in-person for ease of communication and collaboration. It was decided that if we ever needed a meeting to sort out a small detail that wouldn't require a meeting in-person that we could then meet over Skype instead, still allowing us the ability to communicate effectively and easily.

<br/>

The lessons that we should take forward to the next phase would include a better use of the tools we have set up for communication. There was a time early on where we hadn't checked Slack as often as we should have and it lead to a short bit of wasted time, though we have learned to make sure we properly utilize our communication tool going forward.

<br/>

The work we intend to complete in the next phase was discussed in our second meeting, though it was discussed loosely. We decided what we wanted our basic framework to be and who would be working on what part of the project when it became more relevant and decided to hold off on making too many decisions too early on. A meeting will be held again upon the posting of the Sprint 1 handout where we intend to fully complete our ideas on what to complete and how to distribute the work.
