# [Project Reflection]

1.  Tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for our team.

    * We used Github as well as its branching and issues system to keep code organized

    * Weekly meetings were held twice a week, both online and in-person.

    * We used Slack to maintain a consistent channel for aid and communication between members

    * We used appear.in to host video calls and share screens to display important infrastructure or issues

    * We split into pairs to more efficiently work on tasks

2.  Tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for our team.

    * In addition to our weekly scheduled meetings, we sometimes called emergency meetings which just hindered work

    * We had varying schedules of free time and thus were not able to provide support immediately.

    * While we had the branches to isolate new features and their possible bugs, any additional changes and
      modifications were essentially locked to that branch

3.  If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like? 

    Our process for working on this project would be unchanged at its core, however we would try to free up more time
    so that we could focus more on implementing features for the product. Also we could reform our small internal groups
    into larger groups perhaps of 3 people instead of 2 to guarantee that each feature has the amount of attention and
    workforce necessary to have it be as complete as possible. Something else that we were not able to do, since everyone
    had assigned tasks and thus were busy working on them, was having every group member take a look at any completed task.
    We did have a few people confirm functionality, but for the sake of progress we couldn't have everyone stop their tasks
    to check.
